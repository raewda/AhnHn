    <string name="cbwsasfingredients">
        Cold Brew:
        6 cups water(1.4 L), plus more as needed
        2 cups coffee grounds(220 g)

        Caramel Simple Syrup:
        ½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)
        ¼ cup water(60 mL), plus 2 tablespoons, divided

        Sweet Salty Cold Foam:
        ½ cup whole milk(120 mL)

        2 tablespoons granulated sugar
        ¼ teaspoon salt

    <string name="cbwsasfrecipe">
        Make the cold brew: Combine the water and coffee grounds in a large container. Stir until all of the grounds are wet. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
        Make the caramel simple syrup: Add the sugar and 2 tablespoons water to a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. Increase the heat to medium and cook, without disturbing for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is caramel-colored.
        Remove the pot from the heat. Carefully pour in the remaining ¼ cup (60 ml) water and stir to incorporate. Transfer the syrup to a heat-proof container, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
        Line a fine-mesh sieve with a coffee filter and set over a large bowl. Pour the cold brew through the strainer and let drain. You may need to pour in batches so the strainer does not overflow. Return the strained cold brew to a clean container. If the coffee is too strong, dilute with more water to taste. Refrigerate the cold brew until ready to use.
        Make the cold foam: In a medium bowl, combine the milk, cream, sugar, and salt. Whip with an immersion blender or electric hand mixer on high speed until foamy, 2–4 minutes.
        To assemble, fill 2 large glasses with ice. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) cold brew coffee into each glass. Stir about 2 tablespoons of the caramel syrup into each glass. Top with the cold foam. Serve immediately.
